## SpaceX Launch Prediction: Applied Data Science Capstone

This project simulates a real-world data science role at a fictional company, **SpaceY**, competing with SpaceX. The objective was to predict whether the Falcon 9 rocketâ€™s first stage would land successfully using public launch data and machine learning.

## Highlights

- Cleaned and merged data from the SpaceX API and Wikipedia
- Performed EDA using SQL queries, visualizations, and geospatial maps (Folium)
- Built an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree
- Best model: **Decision Tree**, with 94.4% accuracy and no false negatives

## Key Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly Dash, Folium, BeautifulSoup

## Example Insights

- Launch success has increased significantly over time
- KSC LC-39A had the highest landing success rate
- Heavier payloads and certain orbits (e.g., GEO, ES-L1, SSO) showed consistent landing success
- All models reached ~83% accuracy, with Decision Tree performing best overall

## Running the Dashboard

1. Clone the repository:
